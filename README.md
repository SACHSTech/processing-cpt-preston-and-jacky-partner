# Escape Room "mr. fabroa edition" By JP Game Productions
You've fallen into a trap door on your way home and you wake up to find yourself in an abanoned classroom, there is limited oxygen, and you will slowly run out and die. The only way out of this place is completing the puzzles that were setup for you and getting keys to move to the next rooms and to finally escape.

Players will go through the game interacting with objects using 'e' which will bring up clues or puzzles in order to figure out what to do to get out of this place. The players will also be able to input names for required puzzles.

The player will be timed and the one to come out the fast will be victorious.
